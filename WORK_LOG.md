| April 5      |   9-10pm   |                                                                                                                                                            I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| September 9  | 9:00-9:30  |                I tried to think thourgh how I was going to solve the problem remebering what we did in class I decided to try and create the groups of touching city's and use that to calculate cost |
| Sebtember 9  | 9:30-10:00 |                                                                       Started to created instance variables related to my idea and set up private variables so I can access them in all the functions |
| Sebtember 10 |  9:30-10   |                           Started coding my methods I tried to create a method that would group all the cities that touched into their own arraylist inside an arraylist. but it didn't work entirely |
| Sebtember 11 | 9:00-9:30  |                                                                                     fixed my grouping function now It correctly groups all the touching cities into their own array in the array list |
| Sebtember 11 |  9:30-10   | tried testing it but it correctly groups the cities, but I can't get the cost to work and it's also very slow. I got the right cost of hospitals, but failed to correctly calculate cost for highways |
