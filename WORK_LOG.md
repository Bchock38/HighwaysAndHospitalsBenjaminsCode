| April 5      |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                            I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| September 9  |   9:00-9:30   |                I tried to think thourgh how I was going to solve the problem remebering what we did in class I decided to try and create the groups of touching city's and use that to calculate cost |
| Sebtember 9  |  9:30-10:00   |                                                                       Started to created instance variables related to my idea and set up private variables so I can access them in all the functions |
| Sebtember 10 |    9:30-10    |                           Started coding my methods I tried to create a method that would group all the cities that touched into their own arraylist inside an arraylist. but it didn't work entirely |
| Sebtember 11 |   9:00-9:30   |                                                                                     fixed my grouping function now It correctly groups all the touching cities into their own array in the array list |
| Sebtember 11 |    9:30-10    | tried testing it but it correctly groups the cities, but I can't get the cost to work and it's also very slow. I got the right cost of hospitals, but failed to correctly calculate cost for highways |
| Sebtember 16 |   6:00-6:30   |                                  Worked on creating a union find function, but ran into issue/did not full understand how to treat cases that already are filled/ you get AB but A already has a root |
| Sebtember 18 | 9:30-9:50 am  |                                                                                                                       Finished coding basic union find based off the pseudo code on packet. It worked |
| Sebtember 18 | 8:30-9:00  pm | attempted to implment path compression based off of the pseudo code on the slide. It didn't work, but I assumed it was because I had yet to impliment weight balanceing. so I started to work on that |
| Sebtember 18 | 9:00-9:30 pm  |                       Finished implementing weight balancing. but it didn't work, so I tried to troubleshoot, but nothing was working. I eventually decieded to get help during tutorial the next day |
